For instance, implicit non-nullable primary key columns will be handled correctly now using the new Antlr-based DDL parser (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-860">DBZ-860</a>). Also the <a href="/docs/connectors/mongodb/">MongoDB connector</a> saw a bug fix (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-838">DBZ-838</a>): initial snapshots will be interrupted now if the connector is requested to stop (e.g. when shutting down Kafka Connect). More a useful improvement rather than a bug fix is the <a href="/docs/connectors/postgres/">Postgres connector&#8217;s</a> capability to add the table, schema and database names to the <code>source</code> block of emitted CDC events (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-866">DBZ-866</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Thanks a lot to community members <a href="https://github.com/jchipmunk">Andrey Pustovetov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CliffWheadon">Cliff Wheadon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oripwk">Ori Popowski</a> for their contributions to this release!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;re continuing the work on Debezium 0.9, which will mostly be about improvements to the SQL Server and Oracle connectors.

Based on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017">CDC functionality</a> available in the Enterprise and Standard editions, the new connector lets you stream data changes out of Microsoft&#8217;s popular RDBMS.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Besides that we&#8217;ve continued the work on the Debezium <a href="/docs/connectors/oracle/">Oracle connector</a>. Most notably, it supports initial snapshots of captured tables now. We&#8217;ve also upgraded Apache Kafka in our Docker images to 1.1.1 (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-829">DBZ-829</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please take a look at the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-9-0-alpha1">change log</a> for the complete list of changes in 0.9.0.Alpha1 and general upgrade notes.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><em>Note:</em> <span class="line-through">At the time of writing (2018-07-26), the release artifacts (connector archives) are available on <a href="http://central.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/">Maven Central</a>.

Thanks to lots of basic infrastructure created while working on the Oracle connector, we were finally able to come up with a first preview of this new connector in comparatively short time of development.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Just as the Oracle connector, the one for SQL Server is under active development and should be considered an incubating feature at this point. So for instance the structure of emitted change messages may change in upcoming releases. In terms of features, it supports initial snapshotting and capturing changes via SQL Server&#8217;s CDC functionality. There&#8217;s support for the most common column types, table whitelisting/blacklisting and more. The most significant feature missing is support for structural changes of tables while the connector is running. This is the next feature we&#8217;ll work on and it&#8217;s planned to be delivered as part of the next 0.9 release (see <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-812">DBZ-812</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;d be very happy to learn about any feedback you may have on this newest connector of the Debezium family.

By means of the new connector option <code>snapshot.mode</code> you can control whether <em>read</em> events for all the records of all the captured tables should be emitted.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In addition the support for numeric data types has been honed (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-804">DBZ-804</a>); any integer columns (i.e. <code>NUMBER</code> with a scale &lt;\= 0) will be emitted using the corresponding <code>int8</code>/<code>int16</code>/<code>int32</code>/<code>int64</code> field type, if the columns precision allows for that.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ve also spent some time on expanding the Oracle <a href="/docs/connectors/oracle/">connector documentation</a>, which covers the structure of emitted change events and all the data type mappings in detail now.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="debezium_0_8_1_final"><a class="anchor" href="#debezium_0_8_1_final"></a>Debezium 0.8.1.Final</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Together with Debezium 0.9.0.Alpha1 we also did another release of the current stable Debezium version 0.8.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>While 0.9 at this point is more interesting to those eager to try out the latest developments in the Oracle and SQL Server connectors, 0.8.1.Final is a recommended upgrade especially to the users of the Postgres connector. This release fixes an issue where it could happen that WAL segments on the server were retained longer than necessary, in case only records of non-whitelisted tables changed for a while. This has been addressed by means of supporting heartbeat messages (as already known from the MySQL connector) also for Postgres (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-800">DBZ-800</a>). This lets the connector regularly commit offsets to Kafka Connect which also serves as the hook to acknowledge processed LSNs with the Postgres server.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>You can find the list of all changes done in Debezium 0.8.1.Final in the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-8-1-final">change log</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As discussed above, we&#8217;ll work on supporting structural changes to captured tables while the SQL Server connector is running. The same applies to the Oracle connector. This will require some work on our DDL parsers, but thanks to the foundations provided by our recent migration of the MySQL DDL parser to Antlr, this should be manageable.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The other big focus of work with be to provide an alternative implementation for getting changes from Oracle which isn&#8217;t based on the XStream API. We&#8217;ve done some experiments with LogMiner and are also actively exploring further alternatives.

It was a great evening with lots of interesting discussions and questions. One of the questions being the following: what is the advantage of using a log-based change data capturing tool such as Debezium over simply polling for updated records?</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So first of all, what&#8217;s the difference between the two approaches? With polling-based (or query-based) CDC you repeatedly run queries (e.g. via JDBC) for retrieving any newly inserted or updated rows from the tables to be captured. Log-based CDC in contrast works by reacting to any changes to the database&#8217;s log files (e.g. MySQL&#8217;s binlog or MongoDB&#8217;s op log).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As this wasn&#8217;t the first time this question came up, I thought I could provide a more extensive answer also here on the blog. That way I&#8217;ll be able to refer to this post in the future, should the question come up again :)</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So without further ado, here&#8217;s my list of five advantages of log-based CDC over polling-based approaches.</p> </div> <div class="dlist"> <dl> <dt class="hdlist1">All Data Changes Are Captured</dt> <dd> <p>By reading the database&#8217;s log, you get the complete list of all data changes in their exact order of application. This is vital for many use cases where you are interested in the complete history of record changes. In contrast, with a polling-based approach you might miss intermediary data changes that happen between two runs of the poll loop. For instance it could happen that a record is inserted and deleted between two polls, in which case this record would never be captured by poll-based CDC.</p> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Related to this is the aspect of downtimes, e.g. when updating the CDC tool. With poll-based CDC, only the latest state of a given record would be captured once the CDC tool is back online, missing any earlier changes to the record that occurred during the downtime. A log-based CDC tool will be able to resume reading the database log from the point where it left off before it was shut down, causing the complete history of data changes to be captured.</p> </div> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">Low Delays of Events While Avoiding Increased CPU Load</dt> <dd> <p>With polling, you might be tempted to increase the frequency of polling attempts in order to reduce the chances of missing intermediary updates. While this works to some degree, polling too frequently may cause performance issues (as the queries used for polling cause load on the source database). On the other hand, expanding the polling interval will reduce the CPU load but may not only result in missed change events but also in a longer delay for propagating data changes. Log-based CDC allows you to react to data changes in near real-time without paying the price of spending CPU time on running polling queries repeatedly.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">No Impact on Data Model</dt> <dd> <p>Polling requires some indicator to identify those records that have been changed since the last poll. So all the captured tables need to have some column like <code>LAST_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP</code> which can be used to find changed rows. This can be fine in some cases, but in others such requirement might not be desirable. Specifically, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that the update timestamps are maintained correctly on all tables to be captured by the writing applications or e.g. through triggers.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">Can Capture Deletes</dt> <dd> <p>Naturally, polling will not allow you to identify any records that have been deleted since the last poll. Often times that&#8217;s a problem for replication-like use cases where you&#8217;d like to have an identical data set on the source database and the replication targets, meaning you&#8217;d also like to delete records on the sink side if they have been removed in the source database.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1">Can Capture Old Record State And Further Meta Data</dt> <dd> <p>Depending on the source database&#8217;s capabilities, log-based CDC can provide the old record state for update and delete events. Whereas with polling, you&#8217;ll only get the current row state. Having the old row state handy in a single change event can be interesting for many use cases, e.g. if you&#8217;d like to display the complete data change with old and new column values to an application user for auditing purposes.</p> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In addition, log-based approaches often can provide streams of schema changes (e.g. in form of applied DDL statements) and expose additional metadata such as transaction ids or the user applying a certain change.

Note that this is not to say that polling-based CDC doesn&#8217;t have its applications. If for instance your use case can be satisfied by propagating changes once per hour and it&#8217;s not a problem to miss intermediary versions of records that were valid in between, it can be perfectly fine.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>But if you&#8217;re interested in capturing data changes in near real-time, making sure you don&#8217;t miss any change events (including deletions), then I&#8217;d recommend very much to explore the possibilities of log-based CDC as enabled by Debezium. The Debezium connectors do all the heavy-lifting for you, i.e. you don&#8217;t have to deal with all the low-level specifics of the individual databases and the means of getting changes from their logs.

Besides that, there are plenty of smaller new features (e.g. propagation of default values to corresponding Connect schemas, optional propagation of source queries in CDC messages and a largely improved SMT for sinking changes from MongoDB into RDBMS) as well as lots of bug fixes (e.g. around temporal and numeric column types, large transactions with Postgres).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please see the previous announcements (<a href="/blog/2018/06/21/debezium-0-8-0-beta1-released/">Beta 1</a>, <a href="/blog/2018/07/04/debezium-0-8-0-cr1-released/">CR 1</a>) to learn about all the changes in more depth. The Final release largely resembles CR1; apart from further improvements to the Oracle connector (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-762">DBZ-792</a>) there&#8217;s one nice addition to the MySQL connector contributed by <a href="https://github.com/pgoranss">Peter Goransson</a>: when doing a snapshot, it will now expose information about the processed rows via JMX (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-789">DBZ-789</a>), which is very handy when snapshotting larger tables.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please take a look at the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-8-0-final">change log</a> for the complete list of changes in 0.8.0.Final and general upgrade notes.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;re continuing our work on the Oracle connector. The work on initial snapshotting is well progressing and it should be part of the next release. Other improvements will be support for structural changes to captured tables after the initial snapshot has been made, more extensive source info metadata and more. Please track <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-716">DBZ-716</a> for this work; the improvements are planned to be released incrementally in the upcoming versions of Debezium.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ve also started to explore ingesting changes via LogMiner. This is more involved in terms of engineering efforts than using XStream, but it comes with the huge advantage of not requiring a separate license (LogMiner comes with the Oracle database itself). It&#8217;s not quite clear yet when we can release something on this front, and we&#8217;re also actively exploring further alternatives. But we are quite optimistic and hope to have something some time soon.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The other focus of work is a connector for SQL Server (see <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-40">DBZ-40</a>). Work on this has started as well, and there should be an Alpha1 release of Debezium 0.9 with a first drop of that connector within the next few weeks.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To find out about some more long term ideas, please check out our <a href="/docs/roadmap/">roadmap</a> and get in touch with us, if you got any ideas or suggestions for future development.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="about_debezium"><a class="anchor" href="#about_debezium"></a>About Debezium</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.

As announced recently, for 0.8 the legacy parser will remain the default implementation, but you are strongly encouraged to test out the new one (by setting the connector option <code>ddl.parser.mode</code> to <code>antlr</code>) and report any findings you may have. We&#8217;ve planned to switch to the new implementation by default in Debezium 0.9.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In terms of new features, the CR1 release brings support for <code>CITEXT</code> columns in the Postgres connector (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-762">DBZ-762</a>). All the relational connectors support it now to convey the original name and length of captured columns using schema parameters in the emitted change messages (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-644">DBZ-644</a>). This can come in handy to properly size columns in a sink database for types such as <code>VARCHAR</code>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Thanks a lot to the following community members who contributed to this release: <a href="https://github.com/abergmeier">Andreas Bergmeier</a>, <a href="https://github.com/olavim">Olavi Mustanoja</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orrganani">Orr Ganani</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please take a look at the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-8-0-cr-1">change log</a> for the complete list of changes in 0.8.0.CR1 and general upgrade notes.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Barring any unforeseen issues and critical bug reports, we&#8217;ll release Debezium 0.8.0.Final next week.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Once that&#8217;s out, we&#8217;ll continue work on the Oracle connector (e.g. exploring alternatives to using XStream for ingesting changes from the database as well as initial snapshotting), which remains a "tech preview" component as of 0.8.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ll also work towards a connector for SQL Server (see <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-40">DBZ-40</a>), for which the first steps just have been made today by preparing a Docker-based setup with a CDC-enabled SQL Server instance, allowing to implement and test the connector in the following.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>To find out about some more long term ideas, please check out our <a href="/docs/roadmap/">roadmap</a> and get in touch with us, if you got any ideas or suggestions for future development.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="about_debezium"><a class="anchor" href="#about_debezium"></a>About Debezium</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.
