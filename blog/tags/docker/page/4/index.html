This will allow us to get feedback from the community early on, while still completing and polishing specific features. Final (stable) releases will be named like 0.8.0.Final etc.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This release would not have been possible without our outstanding community; a huge "thank you" goes out to the following open source enthusiasts who all contributed to the new version: <a href="https://github.com/echo-xu">Echo Xu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vuckooo">Ivan Vucina</a>, <a href="https://github.com/glistman">Listman Gamboa</a>, <a href="https://github.com/omarsmak">Omar Al-Safi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pgoranss">Peter Goransson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kucharo2">Roman Kuchar</a> (who did a tremendous job with the new DDL parser implementation!), <a href="https://github.com/sagarrao">Sagar Rao</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sauliusvl">Saulius Valatka</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sairam881990">Sairam Polavarapu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Crim">Stephen Powis</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sweat123">WenZe Hu</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Thank you all very much for your help!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Now let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of the features new in Debezium 0.8.0.Beta1; as always, you can find the complete list of changes of this release in the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-8-0-beta-1">change log</a>. Plese take a special look at the breaking changes and the upgrade notes.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="xstream_based_oracle_connector_tech_preview"><a class="anchor" href="#xstream_based_oracle_connector_tech_preview"></a>XStream-based Oracle Connector (Tech Preview)</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Support for a Debezium Oracle connector has been one of the most asked for features for a long time (its original issue number is <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-20">DBZ-20</a>!). So we are very happy that we eventually can release a first work-in-progress version of that connector. At this point this code is still very much evolving, so it should be considered as a first tech preview. This means it&#8217;s not feature complete (most notably, there&#8217;s no support for initial snapshots yet), the emitted message format may still change etc. So while we don&#8217;t recommend using it in production quite yet, you should definitely give it a try and report back about your experiences.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>One challenge for the Oracle connector is how to get the actual change events out of the database. Unlike with MySQL and Postgres, there&#8217;s unfortunately no free-to-use and easy-to-work-with API which would allow to do the same for Oracle. After some exploration we decided to base this first version of the connector on the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/XSTRM/xstrm_intro.htm#XSTRM72647">Oracle XStream</a> API. While this (kinda) checks the box for "easy-to-work-with", it doesn&#8217;t do so for "free-to-use": using this API requires you to have a license for Oracle&#8217;s separate GoldenGate product. We&#8217;re fully aware of this being not ideal, but we decided to still go this route as a first step, allowing us to get some experiences with Oracle and also get a connector into the hands of those with the required license handy. Going forward, we are going to explore alternative approaches. We already have some ideas and discussions around this, so please stay tuned (the issue to track is <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-137">DBZ-137</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Oracle connector is going to evolve within the next 0.8.x releases. To learn more about it, please check its <a href="/docs/connectors/oracle/">connector documentation page</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="antlr_based_mysql_ddl_parser"><a class="anchor" href="#antlr_based_mysql_ddl_parser"></a>Antlr-based MySQL DDL Parser</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In order to build up an internal meta-model of the captured database&#8217;s structure, the Debezium MySQL connector needs to parse all issued DDL statements (<code>CREATE TABLE</code> etc.). This used to be done with a hand-written DDL parser which worked reasonably well, but over time it also revealed some shortcomings; as the DDL language is quite extensive, we saw repeatedly bug reports caused by some specific DDL constructs not being parseable.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So we decided to go back to the drawing board and came up with a brand new parser design. Thanks to the great work of Roman Kuchar, we now have a completely new DDL parser which is based on the proven and very mature <a href="http://antlr.org/">Antlr</a> parser generator (luckily, the Antlr project provides a complete MySQL grammar). So we should see much less issue reports related to DDL parsing going forward.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>For the time being, the old parser still is in place and remains to be the default parser for Debezium 0.8.x. You are very encouraged though to test the new implementation by setting the connector option <code>ddl.parser.mode</code> to <code>antlr</code> and report back if you run into any issues doing so. We plan to improve and polish the Antlr parser during the 0.8.x release line (specifically we&#8217;re going to measure its performance and optimize as needed) and switch to it by default as of Debezium 0.9. Eventually, the old parser will be removed in a future release after that.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="further_mysql_connector_changes"><a class="anchor" href="#further_mysql_connector_changes"></a>Further MySQL Connector Changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The MySQL Connector propagates column default values to corresponding Kafka Connect schemas now (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-191">DBZ-191</a>). That&#8217;s beneficial when using Avro as serialization format and the schema registry with compatibility checking enabled.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>By setting the <code>include.query</code> connector option to true, you can add the original query that caused a data change to the corresponding CDC events (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-706">DBZ-706</a>).

Depending on the number of issues reported, we&#8217;ll either release another Beta or go to CR1 with the next version. The 0.8.0.Final version will be released within a few weeks. Note that the Oracle connector will remain a "tech preview" component also in the final version.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>After that, we&#8217;ve planned to do a few 0.8.x releases with bug fixes mostly, while work on Debezium 0.9 will commence in parallel. For that we&#8217;ve planned to work on a connector for SQL Server (see <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-40">DBZ-40</a>). We&#8217;d also like to explore means of creating consistent materializations of joins from multiple tables' CDC streams, based on the ids of originating transactions. Also there&#8217;s the idea and a first prototype of exposing Debezium change events as a reactive event stream (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-566">DBZ-566</a>), which might be shipped eventually.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please take a look at the <a href="/docs/roadmap/">roadmap</a> for some more long term ideas and get in touch with us, if you got thoughts around that.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="about_debezium"><a class="anchor" href="#about_debezium"></a>About Debezium</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium is an open source distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond almost instantly to each committed row-level change in the databases.

When upgrading from earlier versions, please check out the <a href="/docs/releases/">release notes</a> of all versions between the one you&#8217;re currently on and 0.7.4 in order to learn about any steps potentially required for upgrading.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="new_features"><a class="anchor" href="#new_features"></a>New features</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In terms of new features, there&#8217;s a new mode for handling decimal columns in Postgres and MySQL (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-611">DBZ-611</a>). By setting the <code>decimal.handling.mode</code> connector option to <code>string</code>, Debezium will emit decimal and numeric columns as Strings. That oftentimes is easier to handle for consumers than the byte-array based representation used by default, while keeping the full precision. As a bonus, <code>string</code> also allows to convey the special numeric values <code>NaN</code> and <code>Infinity</code> as supported by Postgres. Note that this functionality required an update to Debezium&#8217;s logical decoding plug-in which runs within the Postgres database server. This plug-in must be upgraded to the new version <em>before</em> upgrading the Debezium Postgres connector.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Speaking of byte arrays, the <code>BYTEA</code> column type in Postgres is now also supported (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-605">DBZ-605</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>For the MySQL connector, there&#8217;s a new option to the snapshotting routine: <code>snapshot.locking.mode</code> (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-602">DBZ-602</a>). By setting this to <code>NONE</code>, this option allows to skip any table locks during snapshotting. This should be used if and only if you&#8217;re absolutely sure that the tables don&#8217;t undergo structural changes (columns added, removed etc.) while the snapshot is taken. But if that&#8217;s guaranteed, the new mode can be a useful tool for increasing overall system performance, as writes by concurrent processes won&#8217;t be blocked. That&#8217;s especially useful on environments such as Amazon RDS, where the connector otherwise would be required to keep a lock for the entirety of the snapshot. The new option supersedes the existing <code>snapshot.minimal.locks</code> option. Please see the connector documentation for <a href="/docs/connectors/mysql/#connector-properties">the details</a>. This feature was contributed by our community member <a href="https://github.com/Crim">Stephen Powis</a>; many thanks to you!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="bug_fixes"><a class="anchor" href="#bug_fixes"></a>Bug Fixes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>0.7.4 brings multiple fixes related to how numeric columns are handled. E.g. columns without scale couldn&#8217;t correctly be processed by the MySQL connector during binlog reading (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-615">DBZ-615</a>). That&#8217;s fixed now. And when using the Postgres connector, arbitrary precision column values are correctly converted into change data message fields now (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-351">DBZ-351</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We also noticed a regression introduced in Debezium 0.6: the field schema for <code>NUMERIC</code> columns was always marked as optional, also if that column was actually declared as <code>NOT NULL</code>. The same affected geo-spatial array types on Postgres as supported as of Debezium 0.7. This has been fixed with <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-635">DBZ-635</a>. We don&#8217;t expect any impact on consumers by this change (just as before, they&#8217;ll always get a value for such field, only its schema won&#8217;t be incorrectly marked as optional any more).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please see the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-7-4">full change log</a> for more details and the complete list of issues fixed in Debezium 0.7.4.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Following our three weeks release cadence, the next Debezium release is planned for March 28th. We got some exciting changes in the works for that: if things go as planned, we&#8217;ll release the first version of our Oracle connector (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-20">DBZ-20</a>). This will be based on the Oracle XStream API in the first iteration and not support snapshots yet. But we felt it&#8217;d make sense to roll out this connector incrementally, so to get out the new feature early on and collect feedback on it. We&#8217;ve also planned to explore alternatives to using the XStream API in future releases.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Another great new feature will be <a href="http://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</a> support (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-566">DBZ-566</a>). Based on top of the existing <a href="/docs/embedded/">embedded mode</a>, this will make it very easy to consume change data events using Reactive Streams implementations such as RxJava 2, the Java 9 Flow API and many more. It&#8217;ll also be very useful to consume change events in reactive frameworks such as Vert.x. We&#8217;re really looking forward to shipping this feature and already have a pending <a href="https://github.com/debezium/debezium/pull/458">pull request</a> for it.

Doing so is usually the right thing and thus remains the default behaviour. But disabling tombstones may be desirable in certain situations, and this gets a bit easier now using that option (before you&#8217;d have to use an SMT - single message transform -, which for instance isn&#8217;t supported when using Debezium&#8217;s embedded mode). This feature was contributed by our community member <a href="https://github.com/rliwoch">Raf Liwoch</a>. Thanks!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ve also spent some time on a few operational aspects: The <code>sourceInfo</code> element of Debezium&#8217;s change data messages contains a new field representing the version of the connector that created the message (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-593">DBZ-593</a>). This lets message consumers take specific action based on the version. For instance this can be helpful where a new Debezium release fixes a bug, which consumers could work around so far. Now, after the update to that new Debezium version, that workaround should not be applied anymore. The version field will allow consumers to decide whether to apply the workaround or not.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The names of all the threads managed by Debezium are now structured in the form of "debezium-&lt;connector&gt;-&#8230;&#8203;" (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-587">DBZ-587</a>). This helps with identifying Debezium&#8217;s threads when analyzing thread dumps for instance.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="postgres_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#postgres_connector"></a>Postgres Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Here we&#8217;ve focused on improving the support for array types: besides fixing a bug related to numeric arrays (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-577">DBZ-577</a>) we&#8217;ve also completed the support for the PostGIS types (which was introduced in 0.7.2), allowing you to capture array columns of types <code>GEOMETRY</code> and <code>GEOGRAPHY</code>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Snapshots are now correctly interruptable (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-586">DBZ-586</a>) and the connector will correctly handle the case where after a restart it should continue from a WAL position which isn&#8217;t available any more: it&#8217;ll stop, requiring you to do a new snapshot (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-590">DBZ-590</a>).</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="mysql_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#mysql_connector"></a>MySQL Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The MySQL connector can create the DB history topic automatically, if needed (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-278">DBZ-278</a>). This means you don&#8217;t have to create that topic yourself and you also don&#8217;t need to rely on Kafka&#8217;s automatic topic creation any longer (any change data topics will automatically be created by Kafka Connect).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Also the connector can optionally emit messages to a dedicated heartbeat topic in a configurable interval (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-220">DBZ-220</a>). This comes in handy in situations where you only want to capture tables with low traffic, while other tables in the database are changed more frequently. In that case, no messages would have been emitted to Kafka Connect for a long time, and thus no offset would have been committed either. This could have caused trouble when restarting the connector: it wanted to resume from the last comitted offset, which may not be available in the binlogs any longer. But as the captured tables didn&#8217;t change, it actually wouldn&#8217;t be necessary to resume from such old binlog position. This all is avoided by emitting messages to the heartbeat topic regularly, which causes the last offset the connector has seen to be committed.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ll roll out this change to the other connectors, too, in future releases.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please see the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-7-3">full change log</a> for more details and the complete list of issues fixed in Debezium 0.7.3.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The next release is scheduled for March 7th.

These types represent geo-spatial data via WKB ("well-known binary") and SRID (coordinate reference system identifier), allowing downstream consumers to interpret the change events using any existing library with support for parsing WKB. A blog post with more details on this will follow soon.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-443">new snapshotting mode</a> <code>schema_only_recovery</code> comes in handy when for some reason you lost (parts of) the DB history topic used by the MySQL connector. It&#8217;s also useful if you&#8217;d like to compact that topic by re-creating it. Please refer to the <a href="/docs/connectors/mysql/">connector documentation</a> for the details of this mode, esp. when it&#8217;s safe (and when not) to make use of it.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Another new feature related to managing the size of the DB history topic is <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-541">the option</a> to control whether to include all DDL events or only those pertaining to tables captured as per the whitelist/blacklist configuration. Again, check out the connector docs to learn more about the specifics of that setting.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Finally, we fixed a few shortcomings of the MySQL DDL parser (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-524">DBZ-524</a>, <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-530">DBZ-530</a>).</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="postgresql_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#postgresql_connector"></a>PostgreSQL Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Similar to the MySQL connector, there&#8217;s largely improved support for geo-spatial columns in Postgres now. More specifically, PostGIS column types can be represented in change data events now. Thanks a lot for Robert Coup who contributed this feature!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Also the support for Postgres <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-506">array columns</a> has been expanded, e.g. we now support to track changes to <code>VARCHAR</code> and <code>DATE</code> array columns. Note that the connector doesn&#8217;t yet work with geo-spatial array columns (should you ever have those), but this <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-571">should be added</a> soon, too.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you&#8217;d like to include just a subset of the rows of a captured table in snapshots, you may like the ability to <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-506">specify dedicated SELECT statements</a> to do so. For instance this can be used to exclude any logically deleted records&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which you can recognize based on some flag in that table&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;from the snapshot.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>A few bugs in this connector where reported and fixed by community members, too, e.g. the connector can be <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-519">correctly paused</a> now (thanks, Andrey Pustovetov), and we fixed an issue which could potentially have committed an <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-521">incorrect offset</a> to Kafka Connect (thanks, Thon Mekathikom).</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="mongodb_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#mongodb_connector"></a>MongoDB Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you&#8217;ve ever compared the structures of change events emitted by the Debezium RDBMS connectors (MySQL, Postgres) and the MongoDB connector, you&#8217;ll know that the message structure of the latter is a bit different than the others. Due to the schemaless nature of MongoDB, the change events essentially contain a String with a JSON representation of the applied insert or patch. This structure cannot be consumed by existing sink connectors, such as the Confluent connectors for JDBC or Elasticsearch.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This gets <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-409">possible now</a> by means of a newly added single message transformation (SMT), which parses these JSON strings and creates a structured Kafka Connect record from it (thanks, Sairam Polavarapu!). When applying this SMT to the JDBC sink connector, you can now stream data changes from MongoDB to any supported relational database.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Note that this SMT is work-in-progress, details of its emitted message structure may still change. Also there are some inherent limitations to what can be achieved with it, if you e.g. have arrays in your MongoDB documents, the record created by this SMT will be structured accordingly, but many sink connectors cannot process such structure.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We have some ideas for further development here, e.g. there could be <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-561">an option</a> for flattening out (non-array) nested structures, so that e.g. <code>{ "address" { "street" : "..." } }</code> would be represented as <code>address_street</code>, which then could be consumed by sink connectors expecting a flat structure.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The new SMT is described in detail in <a href="/docs/configuration/mongodb-event-flattening/">our docs</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please see the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-7-2">full change log</a> for more details and the complete list of issues fixed in Debezium 0.7.2.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The 0.7.3 release is scheduled for February 14th.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ll focus on some more bug fixes, also we&#8217;re working on having Debezium regulary emit <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-409">heartbeat messages</a> to a dedicated topic. This will be practical for diagnostic purposes but also help to regularly trigger commits of the offset in Kafka Connect. That&#8217;s beneficial in certain situations when capturing tables which only very infrequently change.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ve also worked out <a href="/docs/roadmap/">a roadmap</a> describing our ideas for future work on Debezium, going beyond the next bugfix releases.
