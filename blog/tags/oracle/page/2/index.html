Overall, this release contains <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-9-0-alpha2">55 fixes</a> (note that a few of these have been merged back to 0.8.x and are contained in earlier 0.8 releases, too).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>A big "Thank You" is in order to community members <a href="https://github.com/jchipmunk">Andrey Pustovetov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/artiship">Artiship Artiship</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CliffWheadon">Cliff Wheadon</a>, <a href="https://github.com/deepakbarr">Deepak Barr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ian-axelrod">Ian Axelrod</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ooooorz">Liu Hanlin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/maver1ck">Maciej Bry≈Ñski</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oripwk">Ori Popowski</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PengLyu">Peng Lyu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PSanetra">Philip Sanetra</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sagarrao">Sagar Rao</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SyedMuhammadSufyian">Syed Muhammad Sufyian</a> for their contributions to this release. We salute you!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="kafka_upgrade"><a class="anchor" href="#kafka_upgrade"></a>Kafka Upgrade</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium runs with and has been tested on top of the recently released Apache Kafka 2.0 (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-858">DBZ-858</a>). The widely used version Kafka 1.x continues to be supported as well.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Note that 0.10.x is not supported due to Debezium&#8217;s usage of the admin client API which is only available in later versions. It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to work around this, so if someone is interested in helping out with this, this would be a great contribution (see <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-883">DBZ-883</a>).</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="support_for_hstore_columns_in_postgres"><a class="anchor" href="#support_for_hstore_columns_in_postgres"></a>Support for HSTORE columns in Postgres</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Postgres is an amazingly powerful and flexible RDBMS, not the least due to its wide range of column types which go far beyond what&#8217;s defined by the SQL standard. One of these types being <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/hstore.html">HSTORE</a>, which is a string-to-string map essentially.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium can capture changes to columns of this type now (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-898">DBZ-898</a>). By default, the field values will be represented using Kafka Connect&#8217;s map data type. As this may not be supported by all sink connectors, you might alternatively represent them as a string-ified JSON by setting the new <code>hstore.handling.mode</code> connector option to <code>json</code>. In this case, you&#8217;d see HSTORE columns represented as values in change messages like so: <code>{ "key1" : "val1", "key2" : "val2" }</code>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="field_filtering_and_renaming_for_mongodb"><a class="anchor" href="#field_filtering_and_renaming_for_mongodb"></a>Field filtering and renaming for MongoDB</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Unlike the connectors for MySQL and Postgres, the Debezium MongoDB connector so far didn&#8217;t allow to exclude single fields of captured collections from CDC messages. Also renaming them wasn&#8217;t supported e.g. by means of Kafka&#8217;s <code>ReplaceField</code> SMT. The reason being that MongoDB doesn&#8217;t mandate a fixed schema for the documents of a given collection, and documents therefore are represented in change messages using a single string-ified JSON field.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Thanks to the fantastic work of community member Andrey Pustovetov, this finally has changed, i.e. you can remove given fields (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-633">DBZ-633</a>) now from the CDC messages of given collections or have them renamed (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-881">DBZ-881</a>). Please refer to the description of the new connector options <code>field.blacklist</code> and <code>field.renames</code> in the <a href="/docs/connectors/mongodb/">MongoDB connector documentation</a> to learn more.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="extended_source_info"><a class="anchor" href="#extended_source_info"></a>Extended source info</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Another contribution by Andrey is the new optional <code>connector</code> field within the source info block of CDC messages (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-918">DBZ-918</a>). This tells the type of source connector that produced the messages ("mysql", "postgres" etc.), which can come in handy in cases where specific semantics need to be applied on the consumer side depending on the type of source database.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="bug_fixes_and_version_upgrades"><a class="anchor" href="#bug_fixes_and_version_upgrades"></a>Bug fixes and version upgrades</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The new release contains a good number of bug fixes and other smaller improvements. Amongst them are</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>correct handling of invalid temporal default values with MySQL (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-927">DBZ-927</a>),</p> </li> <li> <p>support for table/collection names with special characters for MySQL (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-878">DBZ-878</a>) and MongoDB (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-865">DBZ-865</a>) and</p> </li> <li> <p>fixed handling of blacklisted tables with the new Antlr-based DDL parser (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-872">DBZ-872</a>).</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Community member Ian Axelrod provided a fix for a potential performance issue, where changes to tables with TOAST columns in Postgres would cause repeated updates to the connector&#8217;s internal schema metadata, which can be a costly operation (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-911">DBZ-911</a>). Please refer to the <a href="/docs/connectors/postgres/">Postgres connector documentation</a> for details on the new <code>schema.refresh.mode</code> option, which deals with this issue.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In terms of version upgrades we migrated to the latest releases of the MySQL (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-763">DBZ-763</a>, <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-764">DBZ-764</a>) and Postgres drivers (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-912">DBZ-912</a>). The former is part of a longer stream of work leading towards support of MySQL 8 which should be finished in one of the next Debezium releases. For Postgres we provide a Docker image with Debezium&#8217;s supported logical decoding plug-ins based on Alpine now, which might be interesting to those concerned about container size (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-705">DBZ-705</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please see the change log for the complete list of fixed issues.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The work towards Debezium 0.9 continues, and we&#8217;ll focus mostly on improvements to the SQL Server and Oracle connectors. Other potential topics include support for MySQL 8 and native logical decoding as introduced with Postgres 10, which should greatly help with using the Debezium Postgres connectors in cloud environments such as Amazon RDS.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ll also be talking about Debezium at the following conferences:</p> </div> <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://kafka-summit.org/sessions/change-data-streaming-patterns-microservices-debezium/">Kafka Summit</a>; San Francisco, Cal.; Oct. 17</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://vxdms2018.confinabox.com/talk/INI-9172/Data_Streaming_for_Microservices_using_Debezium">VoxxedDays Microservices</a>; Paris, France; Oct. 29 - 31</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://cfp.devoxx.ma/2018/talk/AEY-4477/Change_Data_Streaming_Patterns_for_Microservices_With_Debezium">Devoxx Morocco</a>; Marrakesh, Morocco; Nov. 27 - 29</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Already last week I had the opportunity to present Debezium at <a href="https://jug-saxony-day.org/programm/#!/P31">JUG Saxony Day</a>.

Based on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017">CDC functionality</a> available in the Enterprise and Standard editions, the new connector lets you stream data changes out of Microsoft&#8217;s popular RDBMS.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Besides that we&#8217;ve continued the work on the Debezium <a href="/docs/connectors/oracle/">Oracle connector</a>. Most notably, it supports initial snapshots of captured tables now. We&#8217;ve also upgraded Apache Kafka in our Docker images to 1.1.1 (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-829">DBZ-829</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please take a look at the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-9-0-alpha1">change log</a> for the complete list of changes in 0.9.0.Alpha1 and general upgrade notes.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><em>Note:</em> <span class="line-through">At the time of writing (2018-07-26), the release artifacts (connector archives) are available on <a href="http://central.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/">Maven Central</a>.

Thanks to lots of basic infrastructure created while working on the Oracle connector, we were finally able to come up with a first preview of this new connector in comparatively short time of development.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Just as the Oracle connector, the one for SQL Server is under active development and should be considered an incubating feature at this point. So for instance the structure of emitted change messages may change in upcoming releases. In terms of features, it supports initial snapshotting and capturing changes via SQL Server&#8217;s CDC functionality. There&#8217;s support for the most common column types, table whitelisting/blacklisting and more. The most significant feature missing is support for structural changes of tables while the connector is running. This is the next feature we&#8217;ll work on and it&#8217;s planned to be delivered as part of the next 0.9 release (see <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-812">DBZ-812</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;d be very happy to learn about any feedback you may have on this newest connector of the Debezium family. If you spot any bugs or have feature requests for it, please create a report in our <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ">JIRA tracker</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="oracle_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#oracle_connector"></a>Oracle Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Debezium connector for Oracle is able to take initial snapshots now. By means of the new connector option <code>snapshot.mode</code> you can control whether <em>read</em> events for all the records of all the captured tables should be emitted.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In addition the support for numeric data types has been honed (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-804">DBZ-804</a>); any integer columns (i.e. <code>NUMBER</code> with a scale &lt;\= 0) will be emitted using the corresponding <code>int8</code>/<code>int16</code>/<code>int32</code>/<code>int64</code> field type, if the columns precision allows for that.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ve also spent some time on expanding the Oracle <a href="/docs/connectors/oracle/">connector documentation</a>, which covers the structure of emitted change events and all the data type mappings in detail now.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="debezium_0_8_1_final"><a class="anchor" href="#debezium_0_8_1_final"></a>Debezium 0.8.1.Final</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Together with Debezium 0.9.0.Alpha1 we also did another release of the current stable Debezium version 0.8.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>While 0.9 at this point is more interesting to those eager to try out the latest developments in the Oracle and SQL Server connectors, 0.8.1.Final is a recommended upgrade especially to the users of the Postgres connector. This release fixes an issue where it could happen that WAL segments on the server were retained longer than necessary, in case only records of non-whitelisted tables changed for a while. This has been addressed by means of supporting heartbeat messages (as already known from the MySQL connector) also for Postgres (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-800">DBZ-800</a>). This lets the connector regularly commit offsets to Kafka Connect which also serves as the hook to acknowledge processed LSNs with the Postgres server.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>You can find the list of all changes done in Debezium 0.8.1.Final in the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-8-1-final">change log</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As discussed above, we&#8217;ll work on supporting structural changes to captured tables while the SQL Server connector is running. The same applies to the Oracle connector. This will require some work on our DDL parsers, but thanks to the foundations provided by our recent migration of the MySQL DDL parser to Antlr, this should be manageable.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The other big focus of work with be to provide an alternative implementation for getting changes from Oracle which isn&#8217;t based on the XStream API. We&#8217;ve done some experiments with LogMiner and are also actively exploring further alternatives. While some details are still unclear, we are optimistic to have something to release in this area soon.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you&#8217;d like to learn more about some middle and long term ideas, please check out our <a href="/docs/roadmap/">roadmap</a>.

Besides that, there are plenty of smaller new features (e.g. propagation of default values to corresponding Connect schemas, optional propagation of source queries in CDC messages and a largely improved SMT for sinking changes from MongoDB into RDBMS) as well as lots of bug fixes (e.g. around temporal and numeric column types, large transactions with Postgres).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please see the previous announcements (<a href="/blog/2018/06/21/debezium-0-8-0-beta1-released/">Beta 1</a>, <a href="/blog/2018/07/04/debezium-0-8-0-cr1-released/">CR 1</a>) to learn about all the changes in more depth. The Final release largely resembles CR1; apart from further improvements to the Oracle connector (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-762">DBZ-792</a>) there&#8217;s one nice addition to the MySQL connector contributed by <a href="https://github.com/pgoranss">Peter Goransson</a>: when doing a snapshot, it will now expose information about the processed rows via JMX (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-789">DBZ-789</a>), which is very handy when snapshotting larger tables.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please take a look at the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-8-0-final">change log</a> for the complete list of changes in 0.8.0.Final and general upgrade notes.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;re continuing our work on the Oracle connector.

This is more involved in terms of engineering efforts than using XStream, but it comes with the huge advantage of not requiring a separate license (LogMiner comes with the Oracle database itself). It&#8217;s not quite clear yet when we can release something on this front, and we&#8217;re also actively exploring further alternatives.

This will allow us to get feedback from the community early on, while still completing and polishing specific features. Final (stable) releases will be named like 0.8.0.Final etc.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This release would not have been possible without our outstanding community; a huge "thank you" goes out to the following open source enthusiasts who all contributed to the new version: <a href="https://github.com/echo-xu">Echo Xu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vuckooo">Ivan Vucina</a>, <a href="https://github.com/glistman">Listman Gamboa</a>, <a href="https://github.com/omarsmak">Omar Al-Safi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pgoranss">Peter Goransson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kucharo2">Roman Kuchar</a> (who did a tremendous job with the new DDL parser implementation!), <a href="https://github.com/sagarrao">Sagar Rao</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sauliusvl">Saulius Valatka</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sairam881990">Sairam Polavarapu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Crim">Stephen Powis</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sweat123">WenZe Hu</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Thank you all very much for your help!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Now let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of the features new in Debezium 0.8.0.Beta1; as always, you can find the complete list of changes of this release in the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-8-0-beta-1">change log</a>. Plese take a special look at the breaking changes and the upgrade notes.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="xstream_based_oracle_connector_tech_preview"><a class="anchor" href="#xstream_based_oracle_connector_tech_preview"></a>XStream-based Oracle Connector (Tech Preview)</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Support for a Debezium Oracle connector has been one of the most asked for features for a long time (its original issue number is <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-20">DBZ-20</a>!). So we are very happy that we eventually can release a first work-in-progress version of that connector. At this point this code is still very much evolving, so it should be considered as a first tech preview. This means it&#8217;s not feature complete (most notably, there&#8217;s no support for initial snapshots yet), the emitted message format may still change etc. So while we don&#8217;t recommend using it in production quite yet, you should definitely give it a try and report back about your experiences.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>One challenge for the Oracle connector is how to get the actual change events out of the database. Unlike with MySQL and Postgres, there&#8217;s unfortunately no free-to-use and easy-to-work-with API which would allow to do the same for Oracle. After some exploration we decided to base this first version of the connector on the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/XSTRM/xstrm_intro.htm#XSTRM72647">Oracle XStream</a> API. While this (kinda) checks the box for "easy-to-work-with", it doesn&#8217;t do so for "free-to-use": using this API requires you to have a license for Oracle&#8217;s separate GoldenGate product. We&#8217;re fully aware of this being not ideal, but we decided to still go this route as a first step, allowing us to get some experiences with Oracle and also get a connector into the hands of those with the required license handy. Going forward, we are going to explore alternative approaches. We already have some ideas and discussions around this, so please stay tuned (the issue to track is <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-137">DBZ-137</a>).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Oracle connector is going to evolve within the next 0.8.x releases. To learn more about it, please check its <a href="/docs/connectors/oracle/">connector documentation page</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="antlr_based_mysql_ddl_parser"><a class="anchor" href="#antlr_based_mysql_ddl_parser"></a>Antlr-based MySQL DDL Parser</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In order to build up an internal meta-model of the captured database&#8217;s structure, the Debezium MySQL connector needs to parse all issued DDL statements (<code>CREATE TABLE</code> etc.). This used to be done with a hand-written DDL parser which worked reasonably well, but over time it also revealed some shortcomings; as the DDL language is quite extensive, we saw repeatedly bug reports caused by some specific DDL constructs not being parseable.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>So we decided to go back to the drawing board and came up with a brand new parser design. Thanks to the great work of Roman Kuchar, we now have a completely new DDL parser which is based on the proven and very mature <a href="http://antlr.org/">Antlr</a> parser generator (luckily, the Antlr project provides a complete MySQL grammar). So we should see much less issue reports related to DDL parsing going forward.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>For the time being, the old parser still is in place and remains to be the default parser for Debezium 0.8.x. You are very encouraged though to test the new implementation by setting the connector option <code>ddl.parser.mode</code> to <code>antlr</code> and report back if you run into any issues doing so. We plan to improve and polish the Antlr parser during the 0.8.x release line (specifically we&#8217;re going to measure its performance and optimize as needed) and switch to it by default as of Debezium 0.9. Eventually, the old parser will be removed in a future release after that.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="further_mysql_connector_changes"><a class="anchor" href="#further_mysql_connector_changes"></a>Further MySQL Connector Changes</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The MySQL Connector propagates column default values to corresponding Kafka Connect schemas now (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-191">DBZ-191</a>).
