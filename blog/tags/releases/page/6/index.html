And of course we fixed a whole lot of bugs, too.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Debezium 0.7.2 is a drop-in replacement for previous 0.7.x versions. When upgrading from versions earlier than 0.7.0, please check out the <a href="/docs/releases/">release notes</a> of all 0.7.x releases to learn about any steps potentially required for upgrading.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>A big thank you goes out to our fantastic community members for their hard work on this release: <a href="https://github.com/jchipmunk">Andrey Pustovetov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/notxcain">Denis Mikhaylov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pgoranss">Peter Goransson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rcoup">Robert Coup</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sairam881990">Sairam Polavarapu</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tombentley">Tom Bentley</a>.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Now let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of new features.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="mysql_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#mysql_connector"></a>MySQL Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The biggest change of the MySQL connector is <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-507">support for geo-spatial column types</a> such as <code>GEOMETRY</code>, <code>POLYGON</code>, <code>MULTIPOINT</code> etc.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>There are two new logical field types&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<code>io.debezium.data.geometry.Geometry</code> and <code>io.debezium.data.geometry.Geography</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for representing geo-spatial columns in change data messages. These types represent geo-spatial data via WKB ("well-known binary") and SRID (coordinate reference system identifier), allowing downstream consumers to interpret the change events using any existing library with support for parsing WKB. A blog post with more details on this will follow soon.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-443">new snapshotting mode</a> <code>schema_only_recovery</code> comes in handy when for some reason you lost (parts of) the DB history topic used by the MySQL connector. It&#8217;s also useful if you&#8217;d like to compact that topic by re-creating it. Please refer to the <a href="/docs/connectors/mysql/">connector documentation</a> for the details of this mode, esp. when it&#8217;s safe (and when not) to make use of it.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Another new feature related to managing the size of the DB history topic is <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-541">the option</a> to control whether to include all DDL events or only those pertaining to tables captured as per the whitelist/blacklist configuration. Again, check out the connector docs to learn more about the specifics of that setting.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Finally, we fixed a few shortcomings of the MySQL DDL parser (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-524">DBZ-524</a>, <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-530">DBZ-530</a>).</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="postgresql_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#postgresql_connector"></a>PostgreSQL Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Similar to the MySQL connector, there&#8217;s largely improved support for geo-spatial columns in Postgres now. More specifically, PostGIS column types can be represented in change data events now. Thanks a lot for Robert Coup who contributed this feature!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Also the support for Postgres <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-506">array columns</a> has been expanded, e.g. we now support to track changes to <code>VARCHAR</code> and <code>DATE</code> array columns. Note that the connector doesn&#8217;t yet work with geo-spatial array columns (should you ever have those), but this <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-571">should be added</a> soon, too.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you&#8217;d like to include just a subset of the rows of a captured table in snapshots, you may like the ability to <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-506">specify dedicated SELECT statements</a> to do so. For instance this can be used to exclude any logically deleted records&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which you can recognize based on some flag in that table&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;from the snapshot.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>A few bugs in this connector where reported and fixed by community members, too, e.g. the connector can be <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-519">correctly paused</a> now (thanks, Andrey Pustovetov), and we fixed an issue which could potentially have committed an <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-521">incorrect offset</a> to Kafka Connect (thanks, Thon Mekathikom).</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="mongodb_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#mongodb_connector"></a>MongoDB Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you&#8217;ve ever compared the structures of change events emitted by the Debezium RDBMS connectors (MySQL, Postgres) and the MongoDB connector, you&#8217;ll know that the message structure of the latter is a bit different than the others. Due to the schemaless nature of MongoDB, the change events essentially contain a String with a JSON representation of the applied insert or patch. This structure cannot be consumed by existing sink connectors, such as the Confluent connectors for JDBC or Elasticsearch.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This gets <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-409">possible now</a> by means of a newly added single message transformation (SMT), which parses these JSON strings and creates a structured Kafka Connect record from it (thanks, Sairam Polavarapu!). When applying this SMT to the JDBC sink connector, you can now stream data changes from MongoDB to any supported relational database.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Note that this SMT is work-in-progress, details of its emitted message structure may still change. Also there are some inherent limitations to what can be achieved with it, if you e.g. have arrays in your MongoDB documents, the record created by this SMT will be structured accordingly, but many sink connectors cannot process such structure.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We have some ideas for further development here, e.g. there could be <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-561">an option</a> for flattening out (non-array) nested structures, so that e.g. <code>{ "address" { "street" : "..." } }</code> would be represented as <code>address_street</code>, which then could be consumed by sink connectors expecting a flat structure.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The new SMT is described in detail in <a href="/docs/configuration/mongodb-event-flattening/">our docs</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please see the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-7-2">full change log</a> for more details and the complete list of issues fixed in Debezium 0.7.2.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The 0.7.3 release is scheduled for February 14th.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ll focus on some more bug fixes, also we&#8217;re working on having Debezium regulary emit <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-409">heartbeat messages</a> to a dedicated topic. This will be practical for diagnostic purposes but also help to regularly trigger commits of the offset in Kafka Connect. That&#8217;s beneficial in certain situations when capturing tables which only very infrequently change.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ve also worked out <a href="/docs/roadmap/">a roadmap</a> describing our ideas for future work on Debezium, going beyond the next bugfix releases. While nothing is cast in stone, this is our idea of the features to add in the coming months.

A big thank you goes out to all the community members who contributed to this release. It is very encouraging for us to see not only more and more issues and feature requests being reported, but also pull requests coming in.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Note that this release comes with a small number of changes to the default mappings for some data types. We try to avoid this sort of changes as far as possible, but in some cases it is required, e.g. if the previous mapping could have caused potential value losses. Please see below for the details and also make sure to check out the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-7-0">full change log</a> which describes these changes in detail.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Now let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of new features.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="based_on_apache_kafka_1_0"><a class="anchor" href="#based_on_apache_kafka_1_0"></a>Based on Apache Kafka 1.0</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>A few weeks ago the Apache Kafka team has <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-goes-1-0/">released version 1.0.0</a>. This was an important milestone for the Kafka community, and we now can happily declare that Debezium is <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-432">built</a> against and runs on that Apache Kafka version. Our Docker images were also <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-433">promoted</a> to contain Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect 1.0.0.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="postgresql_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#postgresql_connector"></a>PostgreSQL Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The big news for the PostgreSQL connector is that it now <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-258">supports</a> the <a href="https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json">wal2json</a> logical decoding plugin as an alternative to the existing <a href="https://github.com/debezium/postgres-decoderbufs">DecoderBufs plug-in</a>. This means that you now can use Debezium to stream changes out of PostgreSQL on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/">Amazon RDS</a>, as wal2json is the logical decoding plugin used in this environment. Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/rcoup">Robert Coup</a> who significantly contributed to this feature.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Working on this plug-in, we noticed that there was a <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-379">potential race condition</a> when it comes to applying changes to the schema of captured tables. In that case it could have happened that a number of messages pertaining to data changes done before the schema change were emitted using the new schema. With the exception of a few corner cases (which are described <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-7-0">here</a>), this has been addressed when using Debezium&#8217;s own DecoderBufs plug-in. So it&#8217;s highly recommended to upgrade the DecoderBufs plug-in to the new version before upgrading the Debezium connector. We&#8217;ve also worked closely with the author of the wal2json plug-in (big thanks for the quick help!) to prevent the issue when using the wal2json plug-in.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>While the Debezium Docker images for Postgres already come with the latest version of DecoderBufs and wal2json, RDS for now is still using an older version of wal2json. Until this has been updated, special attention must be paid when applying schema changes to captured tables. Please see <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-7-0">the changelog</a> for a in-depth description of this issue and ways to mitigate it.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>There are new daily running <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-495">CI jobs</a> that verify that the wal2json plugin passes our test suite. For the foreseeable future we&#8217;ll support both, wal2json as well as the existing DecoderBufs plug-in. The latter should be more efficient due to the usage of the Protocol Buffers binary format, whereas the former comes in handy for RDS or other cloud environments where you don&#8217;t have control over the installed logical decoding plug-ins, but wal2json is available.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In other news on the Postgres connector, <a href="https://github.com/jchipmunk">Andrey Pustovetov</a> discovered and proposed a fix for a <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-501">multi-threading bug</a> that could have put the connector into an undefined state if a rebalance in the Connect cluster was triggered during snapshotting. Thanks, Andrey!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="mysql_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#mysql_connector"></a>MySQL Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In the MySQL connector we&#8217;ve fixed two issues which affect the default mapping of certain column types.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Following up to the new <code>BIGINT UNSIGNED</code> mapping introduced in <a href="/blog/2017/10/26/debezium-0-6-1-released/">Debezium 0.6.1</a>, this type is now encoded as <code>int64</code> in Debezium messages <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-461">by default</a> as it is easier for (polyglot) clients to work with. This is a reasonable mapping for the vast majority of cases. Only when using values &gt; 2^63, you should switch it back to the <code>Decimal</code> logical type which is a bit more cumbersome to handle, though. This should be a rare situation, as MySQL <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/numeric-type-overview.html">advices against</a> using unsigned values &gt; 2^63 due to potential value losses when performing DB-side calculations. Please see the <a href="/docs/connectors/mysql/">connector documentation</a> for the details.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="https://github.com/rk3rn3r">Rene Kerner</a> has improved the support for the MySQL <code>TIME</code> type. MySQL allows to store values larger than <code>23:59:59</code> in such columns, and the type <code>int32</code> which was previously used for <code>TIME(0-3)</code> columns isn&#8217;t enough to convey the entire possible value range. Therefore all <code>TIME</code> columns in MySQL are by default represented as <code>int64</code> now, using the <code>io.debezium.time.MicroTime</code> logical type, i.e. the value represents micro-seconds. If needed, you can switch to the previous mapping by setting <code>time.precision.mode</code> to <code>adaptive</code>, but you should only do so if you&#8217;re sure that you only ever will have values that fit into <code>int32</code>. This option is only kept for a transitioning period and will be removed in a future release.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Recently we got a <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-390">report</a> that MySQL&#8217;s binlog can contain <code>ROLLBACK</code> statements and thus transactions that are actually not committed. Of course no data change messages should be emitted in this situation. This e.g. can be the case when temporary tables are dropped. So we introduced a <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-406">look-ahead buffer</a> functionality that reads the binlog by transaction and excludes those that were rolled back. This feature should be considered incubating and is disabled by default for the time being. We&#8217;d like to gather your feedback on this, so if you&#8217;d benefit from this feature, please give it a try and let us know if you run into any issues. For further details please refer to the <code>binlog.buffer.size</code> setting in the MySQL connector docs.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="https://github.com/ainagy">Andras Istvan Nagy</a> came with the idea and <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-349">implemented</a> a way for explicitly selecting the rows from each table that will be part of the snapshotting process.

Three weeks after the 0.6.1 release, the Debezium team is bringing <strong>Debezium 0.6.2</strong> to you!</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This release revolves mostly around bug fixes, but there are a few new features, too. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of the changes.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="postgresql_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#postgresql_connector"></a>PostgreSQL Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The big news for the Postgres connector is that Debezium now runs against <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-424">PostgreSQL 10</a> thanks to a contribution from <a href="https://github.com/ScofieldXu">Scofield Xu</a>. As a part of this change we are providing a <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-426">Docker Image</a> with PostgreSQL 10, too, and we have set up a <a href="http://ci.hibernate.org/view/Debezium/job/debezium-postgresql-10-test/">daily run</a> of our integration tests against it.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you are building Postgres yourself using the Debezium <a href="https://github.com/debezium/postgres-decoderbufs">logical decoding plug-in</a>, you can save quite some megabytes if you don&#8217;t need the PostGIS geometric extension: thanks to the work by <a href="https://github.com/QazerLab">Danila Kiver</a>, it&#8217;s now possible to omit that extension.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="mysql_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#mysql_connector"></a>MySQL Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We&#8217;ve received multiple reports related to parsing MySQL DDL statements, e.g. there were a few specific invocations of the <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statement which weren&#8217;t handled correctly. Those as well as a few other parser bugs have been fixed.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you work with the <code>TIMESTAMP</code> column type and your Kafka Connect server isn&#8217;t using UTC as timezone, then the fix for <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-260">DBZ-260</a> is applying to you. In that case, the ISO 8601 formatted String emitted by Debezium would have, incorrectly, contained the UTC date and time plus the zone offset (as per the time zone the Kafka Connect server is located in) before. Whereas now it will contain the date and time adjusted to the zone offset. This may require adjustments to to downstream consumers if they were relying on the previous, incorrect behavior.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-217">DBZ-217</a> gives you more flexibility for handling corrupt events encountered in the MySQL binlog. By default, the connector will stop at the problematic event in such case. But you now also have the option to just log the event and its position and continue the processing after it.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Another nice improvement for the MySQL connector is a much reduced CPU load after the snapshot has been completed, when using the "snapshot only" mode (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-396">DBZ-396</a>).</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="mongodb_connector"><a class="anchor" href="#mongodb_connector"></a>MongoDB Connector</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This connector received an important fix applying when more than one thread is used to performing the initial snapshot (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-438">DBZ-438</a>). Before, it could happen that single messages got lost during snapshotting which is fixed now.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="examples_and_docker_images"><a class="anchor" href="#examples_and_docker_images"></a>Examples and Docker Images</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>We have expanded our examples repository with <a href="https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/tutorial#using-mysql-and-the-avro-message-format">an Avro example</a>, which may be interesting to you if you&#8217;d like to not work with JSON messages but rather the compact Avro binary format and the Confluent schema registry.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>As a part of our release process we are now creating <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/projects/DBZ/issues/DBZ-418">micro tags</a> for our Docker images for every released version. While tags in the format <code>x.y.z</code> are fixed in time, tags in the format <code>x.y</code> are rolling updates and always point to the latest micro release of that image.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>Please see the <a href="/docs/releases/#release-0-6-2">full change log</a> for more details and the complete list of fixed issues.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="what_s_next"><a class="anchor" href="#what_s_next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p>The Debezium 0.7 release is planned to be out in two to three weeks from now.</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>It will contain the move to Apache Kafka 1.0.0 and bring support for the wal2json logical decoding plug-in for Postgres. This will eventually allow to use the Debezium Postgres connector on Amazon RDS (once the correct wal2json version is available there).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>In parallel, the work around handling updates to the whitelist configuration of the MySQL connector continues (it may be ready for 0.7.0), and so does the work on the Oracle connector (which will be shipping in a future release).</p> </div> <div class="paragraph"> <p>If you&#8217;d like to contribute, please let us know.
